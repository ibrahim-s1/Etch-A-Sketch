# Etch-A-Sketch

The most challenging part of this project was starting it. Initially, I found it to be Intimidating however, after breaking it down it turned out to be fun.

I learnt that I forgot a bit of what I learnt but after googling and reading reddit/stackoverflow posts, I was able to complete the project. For clarification I searched specific questions revolving around the specific problem I was facing.

The main problem I faced was dynamically adding the divs in the container without it overflowing. I quickly realised that dividing the width/height by the number of divs i want in each row gives me the px size. Overcoming this hurdle gave me a confidence boost and so the rest of the project was easy

# Improvements

I need to add a input range instead of the prompt to change the size of the divs
